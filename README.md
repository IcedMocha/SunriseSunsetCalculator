SunriseSunsetCalculator
=======================
Calculate the sunset and sunrise time based on the date and the latitude/longitude.

Based on the algorithm found on : 
http://williams.best.vwh.net/sunrise_sunset_algorithm.htm

Could be vastly improved by wrapping it into a class but this was done as a proof of concept so I'm leaving it as is for the moment.

To use, simply enter the necessary inputs at the beginnning of the script. More info on the zenith parameter can be found here:

Finally, don't forget to modify the offset for the timezone. Best is to leave it at 0 to get UTC.
